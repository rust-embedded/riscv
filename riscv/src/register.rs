//! # On Floating-Point CSRs
//!
//! We are deliberately *not* providing instructions that could change the floating-point rounding
//! mode or exception behavior or read the accrued exceptions flags: `frcsr`, `fscsr`, `fsrm`,
//! `frflags`, `fsflags`.
//!
//! Rust makes no guarantees whatsoever about the contents of the accrued exceptions register: Rust
//! floating-point operations may or may not result in this register getting updated with exception
//! state, and the register can change between two invocations of this function even when no
//! floating-point operations appear in the source code (since floating-point operations appearing
//! earlier or later can be reordered).
//!
//! Modifying the rounding mode leads to **immediate Undefined Behavior**: Rust assumes that the
//! default rounding mode is always set and will optimize accordingly. This even applies when the
//! rounding mode is altered and later reset to its original value without any floating-point
//! operations appearing in the source code between those operations (since floating-point
//! operations appearing earlier or later can be reordered).
//!
//! If you need to perform some floating-point operations and check whether they raised an
//! exception, use a single inline assembly block for the entire sequence of operations.
//!
//! If you need to perform some floating-point operations under a different rounding mode, use a
//! single inline assembly block and make sure to restore the original rounding mode before the end
//! of the block.
