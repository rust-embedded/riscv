//! Interacting with debugging agent
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! This example will show how to terminate the QEMU session. The program
//! should be running under QEMU with semihosting enabled
//! (use `-semihosting` flag).
//!
//! Target program:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use riscv_semihosting::debug::{self, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE};
//!
//! if 2 == 2 {
//!     // report success
//!     debug::exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
//! } else {
//!     // report failure
//!     debug::exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
//! }
//!```
